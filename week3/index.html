        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ol id="content">
            <li> Objects represent entities of the real world. Actions are represented in JavaScript by
                functions in
                properties. A function that is a
                property of an object is called its method.Methods allow objects to “act” like object.doSomething().
                Methods can reference the object as <a href="object.html">this</a>.
                <ol>
                    The value of this is defined at run-time.
                    <li>When a function is declared, it may use this, but that this has no value until the function is
                        called.</li>
                    <li>A function can be copied between objects.
                    </li>
                    <li>When a function is called in the “method” syntax: object.method(), the value of this during the
                        call
                        is object.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li> <a href="math.html">The Math object</a> is a built-in object that has several properties representing
                mathematical constants, as
                well as methods that carry out a number of common mathematical operations.

                All the properties and methods of the Math object are immutable and unable to be changed.
            </li>

            <li><a href="date.html">The Date Object</a>
                Date objects contain information about dates and times. Each object represents a single moment in time.
            </li>
            <li> <a href="dom.html">The Document Object Model (DOM)</a> allows you to access elements of a web page and
                enable
                interaction with
                the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and
                even altering how they are styled.</li>
            <li>
                There are some methods from DOM Level 0 that can still be employed to access commonly used elements.
                These include:
                <ol>
                    <li>Document.body returns the body element of a web page.
                    </li>
                    <li>Document.images returns a node list of all the images contained in the document.</li>
                    <li> Document.links returns a node list of all the <a> elements and <area> elements that have an
                            href attribute/li>
                    <li> Document.anchors returns a node list of all the <a> elements that have a name attribute.
                    </li>
                    <li> Document.forms returns a node list of all the forms in the document.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>We also can get Elements from Dom by getElementById(), getElementClassName(), getElementByTagName()
                methods.</li>
            <li>The document.querySelector() method allows us to use CSS notation to find thefirstelement in the
                document that matches that matches a CSS selector provided as an argument. If no elements match, it will
                return null .

                The document.querySelectorAll() method also uses CSS notation but returns a node list ofallthe elements
                in the document that match the CSS query selector. If no elements match, it will return an empty node
                list./li>
               
                <li> <a href="event.html">Events</a> occur when a user interacts with a web page.

                    An event listener is attached to an element, then invokes a callback function when the event occurs.

                    The event object is passed to the callback function as an argument, and contains lots of properties
                    and methods relating to the event.

                    There are many types of event, including mouse events, keyboard events, and touch events.

                    You can remove an event using the removeEventListener method.</li>
        </ol>


        <h3>Questions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><a href=""></a>Should we always write the script tag at the end of the body element for it to be executed completely? </li>
            <li>Is it better to use Object.create(Array.prototype) or create new Array()?</li>
        <li>Is it common to use indexes in Array.prototype.splice()?</li>

        </ol>
