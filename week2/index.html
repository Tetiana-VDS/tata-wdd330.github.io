        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>This week I have learned terms as expression, . A fragment of code that produces a value is called an
                expression ( 22 or "psychoanalysis"). </li>
            <li>Variables are used in programming languages to refer to a value stored in memory.Using const and let to
                declare variables means they areblock scoped, so their value only exists inside the block they are
                declared in.Any variable declared outside of a block is said to haveglobal scope. This means it is
                accessible everywhere in the program.Local scope work only inside a block.</li>
            <li>Naming Constants & Variables. Constant and variable names can start with any upper or lower-case letter,
                an underscore, _ , or dollar character, $ . They can also contain numbers, but cannot start with them.
            </li>
            <li>Primitive Data Types
                JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them areprimitive data typesand are listed below:

                String

                Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.)

                Number

                Boolean

                Undefined

                Null
            </li>
            <li><a href="">Incrementing Values</a></li>
        </ol>


        <h3>Questions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><a href=""></a>There are many Reserved Words that cannot be used in writing code, do programmers need to
                know them by heart or what would happen if we accidentally use one of them? </li>
            <li><a href=""></a>Can I use just output of the story for it to work?</li>
            <li><a href=""></a>What is the difference between the property .innerHTML and .querrySelector?</li>
            <li><a href=""></a>Why do we still use here var instead of let? </li>

        </ol>
