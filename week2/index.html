        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ol>

            <li>Variables are used in programming languages to refer to a value stored in memory. Using const and let to
                declare variables means they areblock scoped, so their value only exists inside the block they are
                declared in.Any variable declared outside of a block is said to have global scope. This means it is
                accessible everywhere in the program.Local scope work only inside a block.</li>
            <li>Naming Constants & Variables. Constant and variable names can start with any upper or lower-case letter,
                an underscore, _ , or dollar character, $ . They can also contain numbers, but cannot start with them.
            </li>
            <li>Primitive Data Types. Data types are the basic building blocks of all JavaScript programs.
                JavaScript has seven different data types. Six of them areprimitive data typesand are listed below:

                String;

                Symbol;

                Number;

                Boolean;

                Undefined;

                Null. Non-primitive data types, such as arrays, functions and objects, all have a type of 'object'.
            </li>
            <li><a href="incrementing.html"> Incrementing Values. </a> The increment operator increments (adds one to)
                its
                operand and returns a value. If used postfix, with operator after operand (for example, x++), then it
                increments and returns
                the value before incrementing. If used prefix, with operator before operand (for example, ++x), then it
                increments and returns
                the value after incrementing.</li>
            <li>The ^ character is often used as an informal notation for exponents, so be careful not to use this
                mistakenly when programming in JavaScript. For example 2^3 will not return 8 . There is a specific
                Math operator
                ** , that allows you to write it as 2**3 .</li>

            <li>Arrays are an ordered list of values

                Multidimensional arrays are arrays that contain other arrays

                <a href="array.html">Arrays</a> have lots of methods that can be used to manipulate items in the array
            </li>
            <li><a href="set.html">Sets</a> are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of non-duplicate values</li>
            <li><a href="map.html">Maps</a> are new in ES6 and are ordered lists of key-value pairs. Weak maps have
                their keys not primitives, and the garbage
                collector automatically removes any dead entries when the reference to the original object is
                deleted.Weak
                maps can use the has() , get() , set() and delete() methods in the same way as a regular map. <a
                    href="game.html">Small game using Map().</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="conditions.html">Logic.</a>We can use an if and else statement to control the flow of code. The
                switch statement can be
                used instead of multiple if and else statements

                A while loop and do ... while loop can be used to repeat a block of code while a condition is still true

                A for loop works in a similar way to a while loop, but has a different syntax

                A for-of loop can be used to iterate over an array

                Sets and maps are enumerable, so can also be looped over using a for-of loop</li>
        <li><a href="function.html">Functions</a> are first-class objects that behave the same way as other
            values. A parameter is a value that is written in the parentheses of a function declaration and can be used
            like a variable inside the functionâ€™s body.

            An argument is a value that is provided to a function when it is invoked.</li>
            <li><a href=""></a>Arrow functions are a new shorthand notation that can used for writing anonymous
                functions in ES6.
</li>
            </ol>
        

        <h3>Questions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><a href=""></a>There are many Reserved Words that cannot be used in writing code, do programmers need to
                know them by heart or what would happen if we accidentally use one of them? </li>
            <li><a href=""></a>Can I use just output of the story for it to work?</li>
            <li><a href=""></a>What is the difference between the property .innerHTML and .querrySelector?</li>
            <li><a href=""></a>Why do we still use here var instead of let? </li>
